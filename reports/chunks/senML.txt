SenML is an encoding format to represent the sensor values as simple as possible, therefore a simple microcontroller can process it with little memory and computation resource.

Single SenML message can consists of array of sensor measurements along with minimal additional information to describe the sensor itself. This information will solve the interoperability when other systems tries to understand the data. But due to efficiency reasons, it can hold only few meta informations such as, sensor name, and its unit. Before analyzing the examples, we can look at the semantics defined by SenML in the below table.

bn - Base name which is used to attach before all the names in the measurement and it will reduce the size of the complete message.

bt - Base time represents the start time of the first measurement being measured.

bu - Base unit, it will be useful if all the measurements have the same unit.

bv- Base value, it will be added to the values in the measurement.

bver - Version of the SenML media format.

n - Name of a sensor, and base name will be prepended with this name.

u - Represents the units of the observed measurement.

v - The value (number) generated by the sensor.

vs - String value.

vb - Boolean value.

vd - Data value (base64 encoded string).

s - Value sum.

ut - Update time.
 
t - Time.

{"m":[{ "n": "", "v":23.5, "u":"degC" }]}

To process or semantically query complex sensor data, measurements should have additional context about the data. But it is not achievable directly with SenML, instead as expained in this article \cite{su2014connecting} with the help of transformation from SenML to RDF one can explicitly specify the context of each measurement.
