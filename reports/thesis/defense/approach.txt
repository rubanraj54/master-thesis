Approach

Analyzing existing sensor data model specifications.

 - SenML (sensor markup language)
  - Encoding format to represent the sensor values 
  - Show the SenML semantics used to build SenML message
  - Show simple SenML observation structure
  - Cons : Missing option to add contextual information with the observation. 
 (But one can achieve this converting SenML observations to RDF format. But it's like adding one more process in the pipeline and moreover there are disadvantages for using RDF which I will explain in upcoming slides) 
 
 - OGC SensorThings API
  - Offers a unique way to connect sensors in IoT platform
  - An entity based relationship model for handling data from heterogeneous sensors.
  - Show relationship diagram of OGC
  - Stores data in PostgreSQL relational database
  - Cons: supports only PostgreSQL. (So we cannot utilize the complete component in our mediator architecture. However the standard given by OGC SensorThings makes a meaningful relationship between entities in IoT systems. so our proposed data model is designed partially based on the OGC SensorThings standards) 

 - Resource Description Framework (RDF)
  - well known unique model to represent any resources in the universe with subject, predicate and object pattern (like how humans communicate with each other)
  - RDF structure consists of two major components called Document and Statement.
  - Show pics of skeleton layout of document and statement and explain them. 
  - Document is a root element and it may contain one or more statements in it.
  - Statement is an individual building block to represent a single triple.
  - Each statement can have either a reference to other RDF statement or a value. 

  Adv : The primary advantage of adding semantics to the data is interoperability and easy to query them for a meaningful answer.

  DisAdv :  RDF data structure is not suitable for resource constrained devices like micro-controllers. (because of their size). 

JSON LD: 

JSON-LD is an approach to structure the linked data and adding semantic contexts to data in the form of IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier). 
(An IRI is a unique and globally accessible link via web like URI)

show twist message example along with expansion algorithm.


Adv: - JSON-LD solves interoperability issues (as we seen the previous example).
     - JSON-LD one can represent the context for the data which is more important in robotics field such that other robots can understand the data based on context.
     - JSON-LD compaction coupled with EXI4-JSON or
CBOR outperforms state-of-the-art (HDT) with 50 - 60 % [citation] compaction ratios.



Qualitative analysis of recent querying techniques

 - GraphQL
 - Falcor

Give a little explaination about these two frameworks.
