A mediator system for querying heterogeneous data in robotic applications

Problem statement:

Our previous work reveals that not all databases reacts similarly for heterogeneous data from robotic applications.

Storing sensor data as a collection of logs without data modeling makes the consumer inability to execute meaning queries against the data.

Note: Breifly explain an example (For example dev one logs the angular velocity data using the attribute names x,y,z and dev 2 stores the data using different attribute names ang_x,ang_y,ang_z)

Missing global context and relationship for the entities involved in the data generation.

Manual schema transformation in existing mediators.

Challenges:

Finding suitable databases for robotic applications.

Finding potential entities and defining data models and relationships.

Choosing the efficient method to define the contexts for the entities.

Difficult in adopting existing mediators in the context of robotic applications and new databases.
