\chapter{Approach}
To find the best data models for robotic applications and build a scalable mediator, we begin with SOA analysis to find out approaches that have been followed through before for similar data integration applications. After defining the data model, we will collect a list of recent querying techniques and review them based on the features and possibility of adopting them with the mediator as a base.  For review, we would like to consider current well-known querying techniques such as Graphql, and Falcor. At first, our mediator will support only the databases which are selected based on the results from our previous research work \cite{ravichandranworkbench} and other data sources used by ROPOD such as OpenStreetMap. Then, schema's will be defined to map the data being generated by the robot and the data sources. To reduce the complexity of identifying appropriate data-sources by the robot, in our architecture mediator will dynamically choose the data-source respective to the type of data that robots want to store and retrieve. Still, the configuration will be adjustable according to the scenarios. Finally, to visualize the integrated data from the mediator in a meaningful way, a GUI application will be developed based on Node.js stack.
