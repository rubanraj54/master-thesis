To find the best data models for robotic applications and build a scalable mediator, we begin with SOA analysis to find out approaches that has been followed through before for similar data integration applications. After defining the data model, list of recent querying techniques will be collected and reviewed based on the features and possibility of adopting them with the mediator as a base. Current well known querying techniques are Graphql, something 2, something 3. At first, our mediator will support only the databases which are selected based on the results from our previous research work. Then, defining schemas to map the data being generated by the robot and the data sources. To reduce the complexity of identifying appropriate datasources by the robot, in our architecture mediator will dynamically choose the datasource respective to the type of data that robots want to store and retrive. Still the configuration will be adjustable according to the scenarios. Finally to visualize the integrated data from mediator in a meaningful way, a GUI application will be developed based on Node.js stack.
