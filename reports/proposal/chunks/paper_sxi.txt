author [88] built a mediator which is flexible to map domain level query different datasources and efficient to plan the query execution to reduce the overall execution time. Information source models provides relations between the super class and subclasses, and also the mapping between the domain models and information from heterogeneous sources. SIMS uses Loom as a representational language to make objects and relationaship between them. SIMS supports parallel query access plan that makes the mediator to access information independent of data sources and the user will get the final answer as quick as possible.
