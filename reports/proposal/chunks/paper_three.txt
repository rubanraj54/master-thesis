author [12] developed project Tsimmiss extract information from any kind of data source and translates them to a meaningful common object. Unlike AMOS and Pegasus, Tsimmis follows a straight forward approach to define the data model which is a self-describing object model. Each object must contain a label, type and value itself. Label can be used by the system to understand the meaning of the value and type shows the observed value type. Objects can be nested together to form a set of objects. 

Tsimmiss tool offers a unique query language called OEM-QL and this language follows the SQL query language pattern to fetch the data from mediators. Mediators resolves the query and send seperate requests to respective data sources to retrieve the information and merge them together to give a single response back to user. During data integration process, Tsimmiss removes possible duplicates to avoid redundancy in the response. Also, Tsimmiss bundles a default browser tool to query data using OEM-QL language. 

Our approach to develop mediator for robotic applications will adopt the best data model and unlike traditional query languages we would like to attempt new way of querying data for example Graphql.
