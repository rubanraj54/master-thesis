In the articles discussed above, mediators are targeted to extract information from different data sources that could be different databases or data from filesystem. But Rufus system proposed by author [12] focus only on semi structured data stored in file system for example documents, objects, programming files, mail, binary files, images etc. Rufus system classifier automatically classifies the type of file and apply a scanning mechanism on those files to extract the required information and transform them to the appropriate data model which is understandable by Rufus system. Rufus can classify 34 different classes of files. In terms of query language, Rufus can apply simple object predicates and finding text from the extracted information from the documents or files.
